# Keylogger

This Python script records keystrokes and writes them to a file. It uses the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The script will start logging keystrokes in the background.
3. Press the "Escape" key (Esc) to stop the keylogger.
4. The logged keystrokes will be saved to a file named `keylog.txt` in the same directory as the script.

## Security Note

Be cautious when using keyloggers, as they can record sensitive information. Only use this script for educational or authorized purposes.

## Dependencies

- `pynput`: Install via pip if not already installed:
